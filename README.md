## üìù **Description**

The zkSync Era Upgrade Verification Tool is a CLI tool crafted to decode and present zkSync Era upgrade proposals in a human-readable format.

By enabling a deeper understanding of the changes proposed in each upgrade to L1 and L2 contracts, this tool is integral to informed decision-making, voting, and security reviews of proposed upgrades in the spirit of community-driven governance.

<br>

## üåü **Features**


### **L1 Upgrades:**
  - **Facets**: Identifies contract upgrades including additions or removals of functions.
  - **Verifier**: Detects upgrades and parameter changes in contracts.
  - **Solidity Diff Tool**: Compares current contracts with upgrade proposals for verification.

### **L2 Upgrades:**
  - **System Contracts**: Lists changes and verifies bytecode hashes.
  - **Bootloader and DefaultAccount**: Validates bytecode hash.
  - **Solidity Diff Tool**: Compares current contracts with upgrade proposals for verification (only available for system contracts for now).

<br>

## üîç **Prerequisites**

Before installing the tool, you need to ensure that you have `pnpm` installed, as it is required to manage the project's dependencies.

<br>

### **1. Installing Node.js & pnpm**

`pnpm` is a fast, disk space-efficient package manager for JavaScript that works by creating a single version of a module and linking it in multiple projects if needed.

To install `pnpm`, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. If you do not have Node.js installed, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

With Node.js installed, you can install `pnpm` using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

To check if npm is correctly installed in your system you can use command:

```bash
npm -v
```

For other ways of installing pnpm or troubleshooting errors, please visit: [pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).

<br>

### **2. Clone repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <era-l1-upgrade-checker>
```

### **3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

To check if pnpm is correctly installed in your repository you can use command:

```bash
pnpm -v
```

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**
The zkSync Era Upgrade Verification Tool provides a range of commands for interacting with and verifying zkSync protocol upgrade data. Below are the available commands and their descriptions:

<br>

### **Run the Tool**

```bash
pnpm validate
```

### **Commands**
The zkSync Era Upgrade Verification Tool is equipped with several commands to interact with and verify zkSync protocol upgrades effectively. Here is how to utilize these commands:

#### **General**

- `version`: Displays the current version number of the tool.
- `help`: Provides usage information and displays help for all commands.

#### **Upgrade Verification**

- `list`: To list all available upgrades that the tool can verify. `[CHECK IF PERSISTS]`
- `check <upgradeDir>`: To retrieve the current state of contracts for a specified upgrade.
- `show-diff <upgradeDir> <facetName>`: To display the code differences for a particular contract facet.
- `download-diff <upgradeDir> <targetSourceCodeDir>` : To download the code differences between the current contracts and the upgrade proposal. For more info, [please refer here](#download-diff-guide)

<br>

### **Etherscan API Key Requirement**

For all upgrade verification commands, you must specify your Etherscan API key using the `--ethscankey` option:

```bash
--ethscankey=YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
 ```

If not explicitly defined, the tool will check for the environment variable `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` or fail to retrieve upgrade data. You can create an Etherscan API key at [Etherscan API Key](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics).

<br>

### **Parameters Info**

<br>

- `<upgradeDir>`: The directory path containing upgrade information. This is required for the `check` and `download-diff` commands.
- `<facetName>`: The specific contract facet to compare. This is used with the `show-diff` command.
- `<targetSourceCodeDir>`: The directory where the downloaded code differences will be saved. This is required for the `download-diff` command.

<br>

### **`download-diff` Detailed Command Usage**

The `download-diff` command facilitates the comparison of source code differences between contract versions. Here's how to use it:

```bash
pnpm validate download-diff <upgradeDir> <targetSourceCodeDir>
```
### **Steps to Use download-diff**

<br>

1. **Specify Directories:**
    - `<upgradeDir>`: The directory containing the upgrade information.
    - `<targetSourceCodeDir>`: The directory where you wish to save the downloaded differences. If this directory does not already exist, download-diff will create it for you inside the directory you are at. 

2. **Navigate to Directory:**
    - After running the command, navigate to the `<targetSourceCodeDir>` directory.

3. **Use Your Preferred Diff Tool:**
    - Once in the `<targetSourceCodeDir>`, you can use your preferred diff tool to compare the 'old' (*current*) versus 'new'  (*upgrade*) directory structure or specific files.
    - *For example:* 
        - ```diff -r old new```
        - ```meld old new```
        - ```vimdiff old new```


<br>

### **Command Examples**

*Check the current state of contracts using your Etherscan API key:*

```bash
pnpm validate --ethscankey=YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY check <upgradeDirectory>
```

*Download code differences for a given upgrade proposal:*

```bash
pnpm validate download-diff <upgradeDir> <targetSourceCodeDir>
```

<br>

## üß™ Testing

This command will execute all automated tests associated with the tool, verifying that all components operate as expected.
